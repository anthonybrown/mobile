				<h3>Digital Filmmaking and Video Production</h3>
				<h4>Awards Categories</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Best Narrative Piece Submissions to this category includes any fictional work that tells a complete story. This includes (but is not limited to) traditional narrative, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, etc. Among the criteria the jury will use to judge in this category: Story & Storytelling, Visual Quality, Technical Proficiency, Overall Creativity, and Collaboration.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>Best Non-Fiction Piece Submissions to this category must be completely non-fictional documentaries. Among the criteria the jury will use to judge in this category: Story & Storytelling, Visual Quality, Technical Proficiency, Overall Creativity, and Collaboration.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>Best Experimental Piece This category encompasses all pieces that do not clearly qualify for either of the other two categories. These include, but are not limited to, commercials, music videos, expressionistic/abstract pieces, trailers (of original work), television show intros, montages, etc. Among the criteria the jury will use to judge in this category: Visual Quality, Technical Proficiency, Overall Creativity, and how well the piece fulfilled its apparent purpose.
					</p></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>General Submissions Rules</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Submissions may be from 30 seconds to 8 minutes long. Pieces must be submitted individually --
							nocompilations or reels -- and in their entirety on an approved format. The submission media must be 
							clearly labeled with the title.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							SOn each piece, all credited writers; directors and creative producers (if any) are considered submitters. More importantly, no one besides these personnel may be listed as submitters. Using non-students as cast and "below-the-line" crewmembers is allowed.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Class projects are acceptable, but class exercises are not. In other words, all work, from idea to footage to edit, must be original to the submitters. Pieces created outside of class are also acceptable, but the same qualification rules apply
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Each piece may be submitted to only one category. If you are at all unsure which category your piece belongs in, please consult a DFVP faculty member. If a submission is submitted for more than one category, the jury will decide which one best suits it and only judge it in that category. If the jury decides that a submission does not belong in the single category to which it was submitted, it may be moved. Submitters may or may not be notified of these changes. In either of these cases, though, the jury's decision is final.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If a piece does not meet all of these requirements, the jury shall disqualify it from consideration. Submitters shall be notified of the disqualification and the reasons for it. In the case of disqualification, the jury's decision is final.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Submissions must be submitted in DVD format to Art Cohen’s Mailbox.
						</p>
					</li>

					</p></li>
					<li><p>Multimedia Award This award recognizes any project created in response to a Gen Ed assignment that uses a medium other than traditional text. Media may include (but is not limited to) video/film, animation, music, photography, painting, drawing, and sculpture.
